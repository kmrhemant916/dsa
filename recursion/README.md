# Recursion

## Notes

* Solve only one sub-problem rest recursion will solve it
* Write base case
  * Base case will always return something
  * Easiest input to the problem
* Then write problem in terms of smaller (3!) and bigger problem (4*3!)
* Write recurrance relation (most of the time it should return ) Ex. return n*fact(n-1)

## Methods

### Using choises

* If you want to take it or not
* Example - Given a set of positive integers, find all its subsets.
